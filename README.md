## Attention
Hello Tinkering Lab, Due to my video recording app the annotator extension popup menu will not show in the demo video. So when i am moving my cursor to right side of window in the demo video I was showing in the popup menu which was not captured by video recorder app. You will see it when you install this extension.
Sorry for that, I saw this in the last moment.

## Installation

1. **Download the Extension**: Download folder
2. **Open Chrome**: Open your Chrome browser.
3. **Go to Extensions**: Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
4. **Enable Developer Mode**: Toggle the switch on the top right to enable Developer Mode.
5. **Load Unpacked**: Click on the `Load unpacked` button and select the downloaded extension folder.
